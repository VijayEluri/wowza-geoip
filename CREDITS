The original author of a GeoIP module example for Wowza.
This wouldn't have been possible without your example! ;)

A patch author adding additional features like:

	* netmask/cidr support (rewriten completely)
	* use of wowza env variables
	* geoip debug variable to control verbosity
	* regex support for locations in geo.xml (todo - might be overkill)

This was almost completely rewritten to clean up code.
Thank you for your contribution!
