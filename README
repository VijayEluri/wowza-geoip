wowza-geoip

This is a server side module for Wowza Media Server 2.1.0+
allowing you to limig live & vod streams to one or many
geographic locations, based on Maxmind's GeoIP API.

The locations you wish to limit are specified in a
separate config xml file, which is reloaded on each
change, so it doesn't require a Wowza server restart.
